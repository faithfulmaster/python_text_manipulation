"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	21	" When it was the eighth day and it was time to circumcise the baby, they named him Jesus, the name he had been given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	4	33	" Now in the synagogue that day there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	4	34	" ""What do we have to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are! You are the Holy One of God!""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	4	35	" Jesus rebuked the demon, saying, ""Be quiet and come out of him!"" When the demon had thrown the man down in the middle of them, he came out of him without causing him any harm. 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	4	36	" All the people were very amazed, and they kept talking about it with one with another. They said, ""What kind of words are these? For he commands the unclean spirits with authority and power and they come out?"" 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	4	37	" So news about him began to spread into every part of the surrounding region.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	4	38	" Then Jesus left the synagogue and entered into the house of Simon. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering with a high fever, and they pleaded with him on her behalf. 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	4	39	" So he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. Immediately she got up and started serving them.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	4	40	" When the sun was setting, people brought to Jesus everyone who was sick with various kinds of diseases. He laid his hands on every one of them and healed them. 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	4	41	" Demons also came out from many of them, crying out and saying, ""You are the Son of God!"" Jesus rebuked the demons and would not let them speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	4	42	" When daybreak came, he went out into a solitary place. Crowds of people were looking for him and came to the place where he was. They tried to keep him from going away from them. 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	4	43	" But he said to them, ""I must also preach the good news about the kingdom of God to many other cities, because this is the reason I was sent here.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	4	44	" Then he continued to preach in the synagogues throughout the province of Judea.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	1 	"Now it happened, while the people were crowding around Jesus and listening to the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	2 	"He saw two boats pulled up by the edge of the lake. The fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	3 	"Jesus got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put it out in the water a short distance from the land. Then he sat down and taught the people out of the boat.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	4 	"When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, ""Take the boat out into the deeper water and let down your nets for a catch.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	5 	"Simon answered and said, ""Master, we worked all night, and caught nothing, but at your word, I will let down the nets.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	6 	"When they had done this, they gathered a very large number of fish, and their nets were breaking.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	7 	"So they motioned to their partners in the other boat that they should come and help them. They came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	8 	"But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, ""Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	9 	"For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had taken.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	10	" This included James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, ""Do not be afraid, because from now on you will catch men.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	11	" When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	12	" It came about, while he was in one of the cities, that, behold, a man full of leprosy was there. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and implored him, saying, ""Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	13	" Then Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying, ""I am willing. Be clean."" And immediately the leprosy left him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	14	" He instructed him to tell no one, but told him, ""Go on your way, and show yourself to the priest and offer a sacrifice for your cleansing, according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	15	" But the report about him spread even farther, and large crowds of people came together to hear him teach and to be healed of their sicknesses.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	16	" But he often withdrew into the deserted places and prayed.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	17	" It came about on one of those days that he was teaching, and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting there who had come from many different villages in the regions of Galilee and Judea, and also from the city of Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	18	" Now some men came, carrying on a mat a man that was paralyzed, and they looked for a way to bring him inside in order to lay him down in front of Jesus.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	19	" They could not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd, so they went up to the housetop and let the man down through the tiles, on his mat, into the midst of the people, right in front of Jesus.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	20	" Seeing their faith, Jesus said, ""Man, your sins are forgiven you.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	21	" The scribes and the Pharisees began to question this, saying, ""Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	22	" But Jesus, perceiving what they were thinking, answered and said to them, ""Why are you questioning this in your hearts?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	23	" Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you' or to say 'Get up and walk?'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	24	" But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, I say to you, 'Get up, pick up your mat, and go to your house.'""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	25	" Immediately he got up in front of them and picked up the mat he was lying on; then he went back to his house, glorifying God.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	26	" Everyone was amazed and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, ""We have seen extraordinary things today.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	27	" After these things happened, Jesus went out from there and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax collecting place. He said to him, ""Follow me.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	28	" So Levi left everything, got up, and followed him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	29	" Then Levi prepared a big banquet for Jesus in his house, and there were many tax collectors there, and other people who were reclining at the table and eating with them.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	30	" But the Pharisees and their scribes were complaining to his disciples, saying, ""Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and other sinful people?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	31	" Jesus answered them, ""People who are in good health do not need a physician, only people who are sick need one.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	32	" I did not come to call righteous people to repentance, but to call sinners to repentance.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	33	" They said to him, ""The disciples of John often fast and pray, and the disciples of the Pharisees do the same. But your disciples eat and drink.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	34	" Jesus said to them, ""Can anyone make the wedding attendants of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is still with them?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	35	" But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, then in those days they will fast.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	36	" Then Jesus also spoke a parable to them. ""No man tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and uses it to mend an old garment. If he did that, he would tear the new garment, and the piece of cloth from the new garment would not fit with the cloth of the old garment.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	37	" Also, no man puts new wine into old wineskins. If he did that, the new wine would burst the skins, and the wine would be spilled, and the wineskins would be destroyed.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	38	" But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	5	39	" No man, after drinking old wine, desires new wine, because he says, 'The old is better.'""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	1 	"Now it happened on a Sabbath that Jesus was going through the grain fields and his disciples were picking the heads of grain, rubbing them between their hands, and eating the grain.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	2 	"But some of the Pharisees said, ""Why are you doing something that is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	3 	"Jesus, answering them, said, ""Have you not even read what David did when he was hungry, he and the men who were with him?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	4 	"He went into the house of God, and took the bread of the presence and ate some of it, and also gave some to the men who were with him to eat, even though it was only lawful for the priests to eat it.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	5 	"Then he said to them, ""The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	6 	"It happened on another Sabbath that he went into the synagogue and taught the people there. A man was there whose right hand was shriveled.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	7 	"The scribes and the Pharisees were watching him closely to see whether he would heal someone on the Sabbath, so that they might find a reason to accuse him of doing something wrong.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	8 	"But he knew what they were thinking and he said to the man whose hand was shriveled, ""Get up, and stand here in the middle of everyone."" So the man got up and stood there.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	9 	"Jesus said to them, ""I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to destroy it?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	10	" Then he looked around at them all and said to the man, ""Stretch out your hand."" He did so, and his hand was restored. 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	11	" But they were filled with anger, and they talked to each other about what they might do to Jesus.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	12	" It happened in those days that he went out to the mountain to pray. He continued all night in prayer to God.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	13	" When it was day, he called his disciples to him, and he chose twelve of them, whom he also named ""apostles.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	14	" The names of the apostles were Simon (whom he also named Peter) and his brother, Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	15	" Matthew, Thomas, James, the son of Alphaeus, Simon, who was called the Zealot,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	16	" Judas, the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	17	" Then Jesus came down the mountain with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there, as well as a large number of the people from Judea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	18	" They had come to listen to him and to be healed of their diseases. People who were troubled with unclean spirits were also healed.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	19	" Everyone in the crowd kept trying to touch him because power to heal was coming out from him, and he healed them all.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	20	" Then he looked at his disciples, and said, ""Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	21	" Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	22	" Blessed are you when people hate you and when they separate you from their company and reproach you and reject your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	23	" Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because you will surely have a great reward in heaven, for their ancestors treated the prophets in the same way.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	24	" But woe to you who are rich! For you have already received your comfort.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	25	" Woe to you who are full now! For you will be hungry later. Woe to you who laugh now! For you will mourn and weep later.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	26	" Woe to you, when all men speak well of you! For their ancestors treated the false prophets in the same way.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	27	" But I say to you who are listening, love your enemies and do good to those who hate you.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	28	" Bless those who curse you and pray for those who mistreat you.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	29	" To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer him also the other. If someone takes away your coat, do not withhold your tunic either.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	30	" Give to everyone who asks you. If someone takes away something that belongs to you, do not ask him to give it back to you.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	31	" As you want people to do to you, you should do the same to them.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	32	" If you only love people who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	33	" If you do good only to people who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	34	" If you only lend things to people who you expect will give them back to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, and expect to receive the same amount back again.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	35	" But love your enemies and do them good. Lend to them, never worrying about getting anything back, and your reward will be great. You will be sons of the Most High, for he himself is kind toward unthankful and evil people.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	36	" Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	37	" Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive others, and you will be forgiven.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	38	" Give to others, and it will be given to you. A generous amount--pressed down, shaken together and spilling over--they will pour into your lap. For with whatever standard of measure you use to measure with, that same standard will be used to measure for you.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	39	" Then he also told them a parable. ""Can a blind person guide another blind person? If he did, they would both fall into a pit, would they not?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	40	" A disciple is not greater than his teacher, but everyone when he is completely trained will be like his teacher.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	41	" And why do you look at the tiny piece of straw that is in your brother’s eye, but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	42	" How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take out the piece of straw that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not even see the log that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the piece of straw that is in your brother’s eye.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	43	" For there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit, nor is there a rotten tree that produces good fruit.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	44	" For each tree is known by the kind of fruit it produces. For people do not gather figs from a thornbush, nor do they gather grapes from a briar bush.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	45	" The good man from the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man from the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil. For from the abundance of his heart his mouth speaks.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	46	" Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and yet you do not obey the things that I say?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	47	" Every person who comes to me and hears my words and obeys them, I will tell you what he is like.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	48	" He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep in the ground and built the house's foundation on solid rock. When a flood came, the torrent of water flowed against that house, but could not shake it, because it had been well built.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	6	49	" But the person who hears my words and does not obey them, he is like a man who built a house on top of the ground without a foundation. When the torrent of water flowed against that house, it immediately collapsed, and the ruin of that house was complete.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	1 	"After Jesus had finished everything he was saying in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	2 	"A certain centurion's slave, who was precious to him, was very sick and was about to die.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	3 	"But having heard about Jesus, the centurion sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his slave from dying.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	4 	"When they had come near to Jesus, they asked him earnestly, saying, ""He is worthy that you should do this for him,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	5 	"because he loves our nation, and he is the one who built the synagogue for us.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	6 	"So Jesus continued on his way with them. But when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to say to him, ""Lord, do not trouble yourself, because I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	7 	"For this reason I did not even consider myself to be worthy enough to come to you, but just say a word and my servant will be healed.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	8 	"For I also am a man who is placed under authority and I have soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go,'  and he goes, and to another one, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	9 	"When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him said, ""I say to you, not even in Israel have I found anyone with so much faith."" 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	10	" Then those who were sent returned to the house and found the servant healthy.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	11	" Some time after that, it happened that Jesus was traveling to a city called Nain. His disciples were going with him, along with a large crowd of people. 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	12	" As he came near to the city gate, behold, a dead man was being carried out, an only son to his mother. She was a widow, and a sizeable crowd from the city was with her.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	13	" Seeing her, the Lord was deeply moved with compassion for her and said to her, ""Do not cry.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	14	" Then he came forward and touched the funeral couch, and those carrying it stood still. He said, ""Young man, I say to you, arise.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	15	" The dead man sat up and began to speak. Then  Jesus gave him to his mother.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	16	" Then fear overcame all of them. They kept praising God, saying, ""A great prophet has been raised among us"" and ""God has looked upon his people.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	17	" This news about Jesus spread throughout the whole of Judea and all the neighboring regions.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	18	" John's disciples told him about all these things. 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	19	" Then John called two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord to say, ""Are you the Coming One, or is there another person we should be looking for?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	20	" When they had come near to Jesus, the men said, ""John the Baptist has sent us to you to say, 'Are you the Coming One, or is there another person we should be looking for?'""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	21	" In that hour he cured many people from sicknesses and afflictions and from evil spirits, and he granted many blind people the ability to see.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	22	" Jesus answered and said to them, ""After you have gone on your way, report to John what you have seen and heard.  Blind people are receiving sight, lame people are walking, lepers are being cleansed, deaf people are hearing, dead people are being raised back to life, and needy people are being told the good news.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	23	" The person who does not stop believing in me because of my actions is blessed.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	24	" After John's messengers had gone away, Jesus began to say to the crowds about John, ""What did you go out into the desert to see, a reed being shaken by the wind?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	25	" But what did you go out to see, a man dressed in soft clothes? See, people who dress in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' palaces.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	26	" But what did you go out to see, a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	27	This is he of whom it is written, 'See, I am sending my messenger before your face, Who will prepare your way before you.'
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	28	" I say to you, among those born of women, no one is greater than John, yet the least important person in the kingdom of God is greater than he is.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	29	" When all the people heard this, including the tax collectors, they declared that God is righteous. They were among those who had been baptized with the baptism of John.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	30	" But the Pharisees and the experts in Jewish law, who were not baptized by him, rejected God's wisdom for themselves.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	31	" ""To what then should I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	32	" They are like children playing in the marketplace, who sit and call to one another and say, 'We played a flute for you, and you did not dance. We mourned, and you did not weep.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	33	" For John the Baptist came not eating bread and not drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	34	" The Son of Man came eating and drinking and you say, 'Look, he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	35	" But wisdom is justified by all of her children.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	36	" Now a certain Pharisee was requesting that Jesus eat with him. So after Jesus entered into the Pharisee’s house, he reclined at the table to eat. 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	37	" Behold, there was a certain woman in the city who was a sinner. She found out that he was reclining in the Pharisee’s house, and she brought an alabaster flask of perfume. 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	38	" She stood behind him near his feet and wept. Then she began to wet his feet with her tears, and was wiping them with the hairs of her head, kissing his feet, and anointing them with perfume.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	39	" When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this, he thought to himself, saying, ""If this man were a prophet, then he would know who and what type of woman is touching him that she is a sinner.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	40	" Jesus responded and said to him, ""Simon, I have something to say to you."" He said, ""Say it, Teacher!""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	41	" Jesus said, ""There were two debtors to a certain lender. The one owed  five hundred denarii, and the other owed fifty denarii.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	42	" Since they had no money to pay, he forgave them both. Therefore, which of them will love him more?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	43	" Simon answered him and said, ""I suppose the one whom he forgave the most."" Jesus said to him, ""You have judged correctly.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	44	" Jesus turned to the woman and said to Simon, ""You see this woman. I have entered into your house. You gave me no water for my feet, but she, with her tears, has wet my feet and wiped them with her hair.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	45	" You did not give me a kiss, but she, from when I first came in, did not stop kissing my feet.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	46	" You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfume.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	47	" On account of this, I say to you that she who had many sins and has been forgiven much, has also loved much. But he who is forgiven only a little, loves only a little.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	48	" Then he said to her, ""Your sins are forgiven.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	49	" Those reclining together began to say among themselves, ""Who is this that even forgives sins?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	7	50	" Then Jesus said to the woman, ""Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	1 	"It happened soon afterwards that Jesus began traveling around to different cities and villages, preaching and proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God and the twelve went with him,

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	2 	"as well as certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and diseases. They were Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had been driven out,

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	4 	"Now, when a large crowd of people had gathered together, including people who were coming to him from many different cities, he spoke to them using a parable.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	7 	"Still other seeds fell among thorn plants, and the thorn plants grew up together with the seeds and choked them.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	8 	"But some of the seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop that was a hundred times greater."" After Jesus had said these things, he called out, ""Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	9 	"Then his disciples asked him what this parable might mean. 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	10	" Jesus said to them, ""You have been given the privilege of understanding the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but the rest of the people will only be taught with parables, so that 'seeing they will not really see, and hearing they will not really understand.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	11	" Now this is what the parable means. The seed is the word of God.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	12	" The seeds that fell by the wayside are people who have heard the word, but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and be saved.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	13	" Then, the ones that fell on the rocky ground are people who, when they have heard the word, receive it with joy, but they do not have any roots; they only believe for a while, and then during a time of testing they fall away.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	14	"  The seeds that fell among the thorn plants are people who have heard the word, but as they go on their way, they become choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and so they bring no fruit to maturity.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	15	" But the seeds that fell on the good ground, these are people who, with an honest and good heart, after they have heard the word, hold onto it securely and produce fruit with perseverance.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	16	" Now, no one, when he has lighted a lamp, covers it with a bowl or puts it under a bed. Rather, he puts it on a lampstand, so that everyone who enters may see the light.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	18	" So be careful how you listen, because whoever has, to him will be given more, and whoever has not, from him will be taken away even what he thinks he has.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	19	" Then Jesus' mother and brothers came to him, but they could not come near him because of the crowd.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	20	" And it was told him, ""Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	21	" But Jesus answered and said to them, ""My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God, and obey it.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	22	" Now it happened on one of those days that Jesus and his disciples entered into a boat, and he said to them, ""Let us go over to the other side of the lake."" Then they set sail.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	23	" But as they sailed, Jesus fell asleep, and a storm of very strong winds came up over the lake, and their boat started filling up with water, and they were in serious danger.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	24	" Then Jesus' disciples came over to him and woke him up, saying, ""Master, master, we are about to die!"" He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased, and there was a calm.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	25	" Then he said to them, ""Where is your faith?"" Being afraid, they were very amazed, saying one to another, ""Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	26	" They arrived at the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	27	" When Jesus stepped out on the land, a certain man from the city met him, and this man had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and did not live in a house, but rather in the tombs.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	28	" When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him. With a loud voice he said, ""What do I have to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	29	" For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man, because many times it had seized him. Even though he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, he would break the bonds apart and be driven by the demon into the wilderness.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	30	" Then Jesus asked him, ""What is your name?"" And he said, ""Army,"" for many demons had entered into him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	31	" They kept imploring him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	32	" Now a herd of many pigs was there feeding on the hill, and the demons implored him to permit them to enter into the pigs. He permitted them to do that.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	33	" So the demons came out of the man and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep hill into the lake and were drowned.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	34	" When the men who were tending the pigs saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the city and out in the countryside.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	35	" So the people who heard about it went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out. He was clothed and in his right mind, sitting at the feet of Jesus, and they were afraid.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	36	" Then the ones who had seen what happened told the others how the man who was controlled by demons had been saved.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	37	" All the people of the region of the Gerasenes and the surrounding area asked Jesus to depart from them, for they were gripped with great fear. So he entered into the boat to return.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	38	" The man from whom the demons had gone out pleaded with Jesus to let him go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	39	" ""Return to your house and recount all the great things God has done for you."" The man went on his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city all the great things Jesus had done for him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	40	" As Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	41	" Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was one of the leaders of the synagogue. Jairus fell down at Jesus’ feet and implored him to come to his house,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	42	" for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he was going, the crowds of people were pressing up against him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	43	" A woman was there who had been bleeding for twelve years and had spent all her money on physicians, but could not be healed by any of them.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	44	" She came behind Jesus and touched the border of his garment, and immediately her bleeding stopped.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	45	" Jesus said, ""Who is it that touched me?"" When all denied it, Peter said, ""Master, the crowds of people are pressing in on you and crowding you.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	46	" But Jesus said, ""Someone did touch me, for I knew that power was going out from me.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	47	" When the woman saw that she could not hide what she had done, she came trembling. Falling down before Jesus, she declared in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched him and how she was healed immediately.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	48	" Then he said to her, ""Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	49	" While he was still speaking, someone came from the synagogue leader's house, saying, ""Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the teacher.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	50	" But when Jesus heard that, he answered him, ""Do not be afraid. Just believe, and she will be saved.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	51	" Then when he came to the house, he did not allow anyone to enter it with him, except Peter, John and James, the father of the girl, and her mother.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	52	" Now all the people there were mourning and wailing  for her, but he said, ""Do not wail. She is not dead, but is only sleeping.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	53	" But they laughed at him scornfully, knowing that she was dead.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	54	" But he, taking the girl by the hand, called out, saying, ""Child, arise.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	55	" Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	8	56	" Her parents were astonished, but he commanded them to tell no one what had happened.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	1 	"He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	2 	"He sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	3 	"He said to them, ""Take nothing for your journey--neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money--neither take two tunics.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	4 	"Whatever house you enter into, stay there until you leave from that place.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	5 	"As for those who do not receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	6 	"Then they departed and went through the villages, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	7 	"Now Herod, the tetrarch, heard about all that was happening and he was very disturbed, because it was said by some that John the Baptist had risen from the dead,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	8 	"and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the ancient prophets had risen to life again.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	9 	"Herod said, ""I beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things?"" And Herod  tried to find a way to see Jesus.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	10	" When the ones who had been sent out returned, they told him everything they had done. Taking them with him, he went away by himself to a city called Bethsaida.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	11	" But the crowds heard about this and followed him, and he welcomed them, and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and he cured those who had need of healing.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	12	" The day began to come to an end, and the twelve came to him and said, ""Dismiss the crowds that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and food, because we are here in a deserted place.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	13	" But he said to them, ""You give them something to eat."" They said, ""We have no more than five loaves of bread and two fish, unless we went and bought food for all this crowd of people.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	14	" There were about five thousand men there. He said to his disciples, ""Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	15	" So they did that, and the people all sat down.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	16	" He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke them into pieces, and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	17	" They all ate and were satisfied, and the leftover pieces of food were picked up and filled twelve baskets.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	18	" It came about that, as he was praying alone, the disciples were with him, and he questioned them, saying, ""Who do the multitudes say that I am?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	19	" Answering, they said, ""John the Baptist, but others say Elijah, and others say that one of the prophets from ancient times has risen again.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	20	" He said to them, ""But who do you say that I am?"" Answering, Peter said, ""The Christ from God.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	21	" But warning them, Jesus instructed them to tell this to no one,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	22	" saying that the Son of Man must suffer many things, be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, be killed, and be raised back to life on the third day.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	23	" He said to them all, ""If anyone wants to come after me, he must deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	24	" Whoever would try to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake, he will save it.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	25	" What does it benefit a man, if he gains the whole world, but loses or forfeits his own self?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	26	" Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his own glory, and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	27	" But I say to you truly, there are some of you who are standing here, who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	28	" It came about around eight days after Jesus said these words that he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	29	" As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothing became white and dazzling.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	30	" Behold, there were two men talking with him! They were Moses and Elijah,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	31	" who looked glorious. They spoke about his departure, which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	32	" Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep. But when they were fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	33	" It happened that, as they were going away from Jesus, Peter said to him, ""Master, it is good for us to be here and we should make three shelters. Let us make one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."" He did not understand what he was talking about.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	34	" Then while he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they were surrounded by the cloud.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	35	" A voice came out of the cloud, saying, ""This is my chosen son. Listen to him.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	36	" When the voice had finished, Jesus was alone. They kept silent, and in those days they told no one any of the things which they had seen.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	37	" It happened, on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great crowd of people met him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	38	" Behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, ""Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	39	" You see, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he screams, and it causes him to have convulsions with foaming at the mouth. It departs from him with difficulty, injuring him badly when it leaves.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	40	"  I pleaded with your disciples to force it out of him, but they could not.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	41	" Jesus answered and said, ""You unbelieving and corrupt generation, how long will I have to stay with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	42	" As the boy was still coming, the demon threw him down and shook him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	43	" They were all amazed at the greatness of God. But while all were still marveling at all the things which he did, he said to his disciples,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	44	" ""Let these words go deeply into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered over into the hands of men.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	45	" But they did not understand what this statement meant, and it was concealed from them, so they could not understand it. They were afraid to ask him about that statement.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	46	" Then a dispute started among them about which one of them would be the greatest.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	47	" But when Jesus realized what they were reasoning in their hearts, he took a little child, and set him by his side,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	48	" and said to them, ""If someone receives a little child like this in my name, he also is receiving me, and if someone receives me, he is also receiving the one who sent me. For the person who is least among all of you is the one who is great.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	49	" John answered and said, ""Master, we saw someone forcing out demons in your name and we stopped him, because he does not follow with us.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	50	" But Jesus said to him, ""Do not stop him, for he that is not against you is for you.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	51	" It happened that, as the days were approaching for him to go up to heaven, he resolutely set his face to go to Jerusalem.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	52	" He sent messengers ahead of him, and they went and entered into a Samaritan village to prepare for him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	53	" But the people there did not receive him, because he had set his face to go to Jerusalem.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	54	" Then when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, ""Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	55	" But he turned and rebuked them.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	56	" Then they went on to another village.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	57	" As they were going on their way, someone said to him, ""I will follow you wherever you go.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	58	" Jesus said to him, ""Foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	59	" Then he said to another person, ""Follow me."" But he said, ""Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	60	" But he said to him, ""Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce everywhere the kingdom of God.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	61	" Another person also said, ""I will follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say farewell to them who are at my house.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	9	62	" But Jesus said to him, ""No one, having put his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	1 	"Now after these things, the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them out in pairs ahead of him into every city and place where he himself intended to go.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	2 	"He said to them, ""The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore urgently pray to the Lord of the harvest, so that he may send out laborers into his harvest.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	3 	"Go on your way. See, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	4 	"Carry no bag of money, no traveler's bag, nor sandals, and greet no one on the way.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	5 	"Into whatever house you may enter, first say, 'May peace be on this house.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	6 	"If a person of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him, but if not, it will return to you.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	7 	"Remain in that same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not go from house to house.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	8 	"Whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat what is set before you,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	9 	"and heal the sick that are there. Say to them, 'The kingdom of God has drawn near to you.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	10	" But into whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	11	" 'Even the dust from your city that clings to our feet we wipe off against you! But know this, that the kingdom of God has drawn near.' 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	12	" I say to you that on the judgment day it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that city.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	13	" Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	14	" But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	15	" You, Capernaum, do you think you will be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to hades.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	16	" The one who listens to you listens to me, and the one who rejects you rejects me, and the one who rejects me rejects the one who sent me.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	17	" The seventy returned with joy, saying, ""Lord, even the demons submitted to us in your name.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	18	" Jesus said to them, ""I was watching Satan fall from heaven as lightning.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	19	" See, I have given you authority to tread on serpents, and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will in any way hurt you.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	20	" Nevertheless do not rejoice only in this, that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice even more that your names are engraved in heaven.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	21	" At that same time he rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit, and said, ""I praise you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you concealed these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to those who are untaught, like little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well pleasing in your sight.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	22	" ""All things have been entrusted to me from my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son desires to reveal him.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	23	" Turning to the disciples, he said privately, ""Blessed are those who see the things that you see.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	24	" I say to you, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things that you see, and did not see them, and to hear the things that you hear, and did not hear them.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	25	" Behold, a certain teacher of the Jewish laws stood up and tested him, saying, ""Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	26	" Jesus said to him, ""What is written in the law? How do you read it?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	27	" Answering, he said, ""You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	28	" Jesus said to him, ""You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	29	" But the teacher, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, ""And who is my neighbor?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	30	" Answering, Jesus said, ""A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho. He fell among robbers, who stripped him of his belongings, and beat him, and left him half dead.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	31	" By chance a certain priest was going down that way, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	32	" Similarly a Levite also, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	33	" But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	34	" He approached him and bound up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	35	" The next day he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said, 'Take care of him and whatever extra you spend, when I return, I will repay you.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	36	" Which of these three, do you think, was a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	37	" The teacher said, ""The one who showed mercy to him."" Jesus said to him, ""Go and do the same.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	38	" Now as they were traveling along, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha welcomed him into her house.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	39	" She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet and heard his word.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	40	" But Martha was overly busy with preparing to serve a meal. She came up to Jesus, and said, ""Lord, do you not care that my sister left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	41	" But the Lord answered and said to her, ""Martha, Martha, you are anxious about many things,

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	42	" but only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen what is best, which will not be taken away from her.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	1 	"It happened when he finished praying in a certain place, that one of his disciples said, ""Lord, teach us to pray just as John taught his disciples."" 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	2 	" Jesus said to them, ""When you pray say, 'Father, sanctify your name. Let your kingdom come. 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	3 	"Give us each day our daily bread.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	4 	" Forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who is in debt to us. Do not lead us into temptation.'""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	5 	"Jesus said to them, ""Which of you will have a friend, and will go to him at midnight, and say to him, 'Friend, lend to me three loaves of bread,

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	6 	"since a friend of mine just came in from the road, and I do not have anything to set before him.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	7 	"Then the one inside, answering, may say, 'Do not bother me. The door is already shut, and my children, along with me, are in bed. I am not able to get up and give bread to you.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	8 	"I say to you, even if he does not get up and give bread to you because you are his friend, yet because of your shameless persistence, he will get up and give you as many loaves of bread as you need.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	9 	"I also say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	10	" For every asking person receives; and the seeking person finds; and to the person who knocks, it will be opened.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	11	"  Which of you whose son asks his father for a loaf, will give to him a stone instead, or instead of a fish, a snake?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	12	" Or if he asks for an egg, will you give a scorpion to him?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	13	" Therefore, if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	14	" Later, Jesus was driving out a demon, and it was mute. It happened that when the demon had come out, the mute man spoke. The crowds were astonished!
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	15	" But some of the people said, ""By Beelzebul, the ruler of demons, he drives out demons.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	16	" Others tested him and sought from him a sign from heaven. 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	17	" But Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, ""Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and a house divided against itself falls.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	18	" If Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say I cast out demons by Beezelbul.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	19	" If I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? Because of this, they will be your judges.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	20	" But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	21	" When a strong man who is fully armed guards his own house, his goods are safe,

"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	23	"  The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me scatters.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	24	" When an unclean spirit has gone away from a man, it passes through waterless places and looks for rest. Finding none, it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	25	" Having returned, it finds that house swept out and put in order.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	26	" Then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more evil than itself and they all come in to live there. Then the final condition of that man becomes worse than the first.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	27	" It happened that, as he said these things, a certain woman raised her voice above the crowd and said to him, ""Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	28	"  But he said, ""Rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God and keep it."" 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	29	"  As the crowds were gathering even more people, he began to say, ""This generation is an evil generation. It seeks a sign, though no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	31	" The Queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and see, someone greater than Solomon is here.

"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	1 	"Jesus also said to the disciples, ""There was a certain rich man who had a manager, and it was reported to him that this manager was squandering his possessions.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	2 	"So the rich man called him and said to him, 'What is this that I hear about you? Give an account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	3 	"The manager said to himself, 'What should I do, since my master is taking away my management job? I don't have strength to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	4 	"I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from my management job, people will welcome me into their houses.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	5 	"Then the manager called for each one of his master's debtors, and he asked the first one, 'How much do you owe to my master?'

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	7 	"Then the manager said to another, 'And how much do you owe?' He said, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	8 	"The master then commended the unrighteous manager because he had acted shrewdly, since the sons of this world are more shrewd concerning their own people than the sons of the light are.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	9 	"I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of worldly wealth, so that when it is gone, they may welcome you into the eternal dwellings.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	10	" He who is faithful in very little is also faithful in much, and he who is unrighteous in very little is also unrighteous in much.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	12	" Likewise, if you have not been faithful in that which belongs to another person, who will give you that which is your own?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	13	" No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	14	" Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	15	" And he said to them, ""You justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts. That which is exalted among men is detestable in the sight of God.

"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	20	" A certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores,

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	21	" and he yearned to be fed with what fell from the rich man’s table—and besides that, the dogs came and licked his sores.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	22	" It came about that the beggar died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried,

"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	24	" And he cried out and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.'

"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	11	" It came about that as they were on the way to Jerusalem, he was traveling through the borderlands of Samaria and Galilee.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	15	" When one of them saw that he was healed, he turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	16	" He bowed down at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks. He was a Samaritan.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	29	" But in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed them all.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	30	" After the same manner it will be in the day that the Son of Man is revealed.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	31	" In that day, do not let him who is on the housetop go down to get his goods out of the house. And do not let him who is in the field return.

"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	10	" ""Two men went up into the temple to pray—the one was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	11	" The Pharisee stood and prayed these things about himself, 'God, I thank you that I am not like other people who are robbers, unrighteous people, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	12	" I fast two times every week. I give tithes of all that I get.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	13	" But the tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but hit his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	14	" I say to you, this man went back down to his house justified rather than the other, because everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but everyone who humbles himself will be exalted.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	15	" The people were also bringing to him their infants, so that he might touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	16	" But Jesus called them to him, saying, ""Permit the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them. For the kingdom of God belongs to such ones.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	17	" Truly I say to you, whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a child will definitely not enter it.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	18	" A certain ruler asked him, saying, ""Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	19	" Jesus said to him, ""Why do you call me good? No one is good, except God alone.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	20	" You know the commandments—do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not testify falsely, honor your father and mother.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	21	" The ruler said, ""All these things I have obeyed from the time I was a youth.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	22	" When Jesus heard that, he said to him, ""One thing you still lack. You must sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven—and come, follow me.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	23	" But when the rich man heard these things, he became extremely sad, for he was very rich.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	24	" Then Jesus, seeing him, became very sad and said, ""How difficult it is for those who are rich to enter the kingdom of God!
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	25	" For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	26	" Those hearing it said, ""Then who can be saved?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	27	" Jesus answered, ""The things which are impossible with people are possible with God.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	28	" Peter said, ""Well, we have left everything that is our own and have followed you.""
"

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	35	" It came about that, as Jesus drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting by the road begging,

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	36	" and hearing a crowd going by, he asked what was happening.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	37	" They told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	38	" So the blind man cried out, saying, ""Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	39	" The ones who were walking ahead rebuked the blind man, telling him to be quiet. But he cried out all the more, ""Son of David, have mercy on me.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	40	" Jesus stood still and commanded that the man be brought to him. Then when the blind man was near, Jesus asked him,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	41	" ""What do you want me to do for you?"" He said, ""Lord, I want to receive my sight.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	42	" Jesus said to him, ""Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	43	" Immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. Seeing this, all the people gave praise to God.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	1 	"Jesus entered and was passing through Jericho.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	2 	"Behold, there was a man there named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was rich.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	3 	"He was trying to see who Jesus was, but could not see over the crowd, because he was small in height.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	5 	"When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, ""Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for today I must stay at your house.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	6 	"So he hurried and came down and welcomed him joyfully.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	7 	"When everyone saw this, they all complained, saying, ""He has gone in to visit a man who is a sinner.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	8 	"Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, ""Look, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone of anything, I will restore four times the amount.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	9 	"Jesus said to him, ""Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.

"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	11	" As they heard these things, he continued speaking and told a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and they thought that the kingdom of God was about to appear immediately.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	12	" He said therefore, ""A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then to return.

"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	14	" But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation of ambassadors after him, saying, 'We will not have this man rule over us.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	15	" It happened when he came back again, having received the kingdom, he commanded the servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what profit they had made by doing business.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	16	" The first came before him, saying, 'Lord, your mina has made ten minas more.'

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	17	" The nobleman said to him, 'Well done, good servant. Because you were faithful in very little, you will have authority over ten cities.'

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	20	" And another came, saying, 'Lord, here is your mina, which I kept safely in a cloth,

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	21	" for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man. You take up that which you did not lay down, and reap that which you did not sow.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	22	" The nobleman said to him, 'By your own words I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I am a severe man, taking up that which I did not lay down, and reaping that which I did not sow.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	23	" Then why did you not put my money in the bank, so that when I returned I would have collected it with interest?'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	24	" The nobleman said to them that stood by, 'Take away from him the mina, and give it to him that has the ten minas.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	25	" They said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas.'

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	29	" It came about that when he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	32	" Those who were sent went and found the colt just as Jesus had told them.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	33	" As they were untying the colt, the owners said to them, ""Why are you untying the colt?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	34	" They said, ""The Lord has need of it.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	35	" They brought it to Jesus, and they threw their garments upon the colt and set Jesus on it.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	36	" As he went, they spread their garments on the road.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	37	" As he was now drawing near to where the Mount of Olives descends, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	38	" saying, ""Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	39	" Some of the Pharisees in the multitude said to him, ""Teacher, rebuke your disciples.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	40	" Jesus answered and said, ""I tell you, if these were silent, the stones would cry out.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	41	" When Jesus drew near to the city, he wept over it,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	42	" saying, ""If only you had known in this day, even you, the things which bring you peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	43	" For the days will come upon you, when your enemies will build a barricade around you, and surround you, and press in on you from every side.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	44	" They will strike you down to the ground and your children with you. They will not leave one stone upon another, because you did not recognize it when God was trying to save you.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	45	" Jesus entered the temple and began to cast out those who were selling,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	46	" saying to them, ""It is written, 'My house will be a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	47	" So Jesus was teaching daily in the temple. The chief priests and the scribes and the leaders of the people wanted to kill him,

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	1	48	" but they could not find a way to do it, because all the people were listening to him intently.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	1 	"It came about one day, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came to him with the elders.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	2 	"They spoke, saying to him, ""Tell us by what authority you do these things? Or who is he that gave you this authority?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	3 	"He answered and said to them, ""I also will ask you a question. Tell me about

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	6 	"But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	7 	"So they answered that they did not know where it came from.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	8 	"Jesus said to them, ""Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	9 	"He told the people this parable, ""A man planted a vineyard, rented it out to vine growers, and went into another country for a long time.

"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	11	" He then sent yet another servant and they also beat him, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	12	" He also sent yet a third and they also wounded him, and threw him out.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	13	" So the lord of the vineyard said, 'What will I do? I will send my beloved son. Maybe they will respect him.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	14	" But when the vine growers saw him, they discussed among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	15	" They threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What then will the lord of the vineyard do to them?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	16	" He will come and destroy these vine growers, and will give the vineyard to others."" And when they heard it, they said, ""God forbid!""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	17	" But Jesus looked at them, and said, ""What does this scripture  mean?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	18	" Every one that falls on that stone will be broken to pieces. But on whomever it falls, it will crush.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	19	" So the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour, for they knew that he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	20	" Watching him carefully, they sent out spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might find fault with his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	21	" They asked him, saying, ""Teacher, we know that you say and teach rightly, and are not influenced by anyone, but  you teach the truth about the way of God.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	22	" Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?""

"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	25	" He said to them, ""Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God, the things that are God’s.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	26	" The scribes and chief priests were not able to criticize what he had said in front of the people. They marveled at his answer and they said nothing.

LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	28	" they asked him, saying, ""Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man’s brother dies, having a wife, and being childless, the man should take the brother's wife, and have a child for his brother.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	29	" There were seven brothers and the first took a wife, and died childless,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	30	" and the second as well. 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	31	" The third took her, and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	32	" Afterward the woman also died.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	33	" In the resurrection then, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as their wife.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	34	" Jesus said to them, ""The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	35	" But they who are judged to be worthy to receive the resurrection from the dead and to enter eternity neither marry, nor are given in marriage.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	36	" Neither can they die anymore, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	37	" But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the place concerning the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	38	" Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living, because all live to him.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	39	" Some of the scribes answered, ""Teacher, you have answered well.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	40	" For they did not dare ask him any more questions.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	41	" Jesus said to them, ""How do they say that the Christ is David’s son?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	42	For David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand,
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	43	" until I make your enemies your footstool.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	44	" David therefore calls the Christ 'Lord', so how is he David's son?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	45	" In the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	46	" ""Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love special greetings in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	47	" They also devour widows’ houses, and pretentiously make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	1 	"Jesus looked up and saw the rich men who were putting their gifts into the treasury.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	2 	"He saw a certain poor widow putting in two mites.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	3 	"So he said, ""Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all of them.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	4 	"All of these gave gifts out of their abundance. But this widow, out of her poverty, put in all of the money which she had to live on.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	5 	"As some spoke of the temple, how it was decorated with beautiful stones and offerings, he said,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	6 	"""As for these things which you see, the days will come when not one stone will be left on another which will not be torn down.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	7 	"So they asked him, saying, ""Teacher, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign when these things are about to happen?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	8 	"Jesus answered, ""Be careful that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is near.'  Do not go after them.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	9 	"When you hear of wars and riots, do not be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end will not happen immediately.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	10	" Then he said to them, ""Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	11	" There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and plagues. There will be terrifying events and great signs from heaven.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	12	" But before all of these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you over to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors because of my name.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	13	" It will lead to an opportunity for your testimony.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	14	" Therefore resolve in your hearts not to prepare your defense ahead of time,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	15	" for I will give you words and wisdom, which all your adversaries will not be able to resist or contradict.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	16	" But you will be delivered up also by parents, brothers, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	17	" You will be hated by everyone because of my name.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	18	" But not a hair of your head will perish.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	19	" In your endurance you will gain your souls.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	20	" When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its destruction is near.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	21	" Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are in the middle of the city leave,  and do not let those who are in the country enter it.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	22	" For these are days of vengeance, so that all the things that are written will be fulfilled.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	23	" Woe to them who are pregnant and to them who are nursing in those days! For there will be great distress upon the land, and wrath to this people.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	24	" And they will fall by the edge of the sword and they will be led captive into all the nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	25	" There will be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars.  And on the earth, there will be distress of the nations, in despair from the roar of the sea and waves.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	26	" There will be men fainting from fear and from expectation of the things which are coming upon the world. For the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	27	" Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	28	" But when these things begin to happen, stand up, and lift up your heads, because your deliverance draws near.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	29	" Jesus told them a parable, ""Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	30	" When they sprout buds, you see for yourselves and know that summer is already near. 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	31	" So also, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	32	" Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away, until all of these things occur.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	33	" Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	34	" But pay attention to yourselves, so that your hearts are not burdened with debauchery, drunkenness, and the worries of life. For that day will come on you suddenly
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	35	" as a trap. For it will come upon everyone living on the face of the whole earth.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	36	" But be alert at all times, praying that you may be strong enough to escape all these things that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	37	" So during the days he was teaching in the temple and at night he went out, and spent the night on the mount that is called Olivet.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	38	" All of the people came early in the morning to hear him in the temple.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	1 	"Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called the Passover.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	2 	"The chief priests and the scribes discussed how they could put Jesus to death, for they were afraid of the people.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	3 	"Satan entered into Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	4 	"Judas went and discussed with the chief priests and captains about how he could deliver Jesus to them.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	5 	"They were glad, and agreed to give him money.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	6 	"He consented, and looked for an opportunity to deliver him to them away from the crowd.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	7 	"The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover lamb must be sacrificed.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	8 	"Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, ""Go and prepare for us the Passover meal, so that we may eat it.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	9 	"They asked him, ""Where do you want us to make preparations?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	10	" He answered them, ""Listen, when you have entered the city, a man bearing a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he goes into.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	11	" Then say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, ""Where is the guest room, where I will eat the Passover with my disciples?""'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	12	" He will show you a large furnished upper room. Make the preparations there.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	13	" So they went, and found everything as he had said to them. Then they prepared the Passover meal.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	14	" When the time came, he sat down with the apostles.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	15	" Then he said to them, ""I have greatly desired to eat this Passover Festival with you before I suffer.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	16	" For I say to you, I will not eat it again, until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	17	" Then Jesus took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, ""Take this, and share it among yourselves.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	18	" For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine again, until the kingdom of God comes.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	19	" Then he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, ""This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	20	" He took the cup in the same way after supper, saying, ""This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	21	" But pay attention. The one who betrays me is with me at the table.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	22	" For the Son of Man indeed goes as it has been determined. But woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	23	" And they began to question among themselves, which of them it was that would do this thing.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	24	" Then there arose also a quarrel among them about which of them was considered to be greatest.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	25	" He said to them, ""The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them, and the ones who have authority over them are called honored rulers.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	26	" But it must not be like this with you. Instead, let the one who is the greatest among you become like the youngest. And let the one who is the most important become like the one who serves.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	27	" For which is greater, the one who sits at the table, or the one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as one who serves.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	28	" But you are the ones who have continued with me in my temptations.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	29	" I give to you a kingdom, even as my Father has given a kingdom to me,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	30	" that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom. And you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	31	" Simon, Simon, be aware, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	32	" But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail. After you have turned back again, strengthen your brothers.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	33	" Peter said to him, ""Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	34	" Jesus replied, ""I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, before you deny three times that you know me.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	35	" Then Jesus said to them, ""When I sent you out without a purse, a bag of provisions, or shoes, did you lack anything?"" And they answered, ""Nothing.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	36	" Then he said to them, ""But now, the one who has a purse, let him take it, and also a bag of provisions. The one who does not have a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	37	" For I say to you, what is written about me must be fulfilled, 'And he was regarded as one of the lawless.' For what is predicted about me is being fulfilled.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	38	" Then they said, ""Lord, look! Here are two swords."" And he said to them, ""It is enough.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	39	" After supper, Jesus went, as he often did, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	40	" When they arrived, he said to them, ""Pray that you do not enter into temptation.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	41	" He went away from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	42	" saying, ""Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless not my will, but yours be done.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	43	" Then an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	44	" Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	45	" When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of their sorrow,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	46	" and asked them, ""Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray, that you may not enter into temptation.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	47	" While he was still speaking, behold, a crowd appeared, with Judas, one of the twelve, leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him, 
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	48	" but Jesus said to him, ""Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	49	" When those who were around Jesus saw what was happening, they said, ""Lord, should we strike with the sword?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	50	" Then one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	51	" Jesus said, ""Let this be enough."" And he touched his ear, and healed him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	52	" Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, who came against him, ""Do you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	53	" When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not lay your hands on me. But this is your hour, and the authority of darkness.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	54	" Seizing him, they led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed from a distance.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	55	" After they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	56	" A certain female servant saw him as he sat in the light of the fire, and looked straight at him and said, ""This man also was with him.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	57	" But Peter denied it, saying, ""Woman, I do not know him.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	58	" After a little while someone else saw him, and said, ""You are also one of them."" But Peter said, ""Man, I am not.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	59	" After about an hour another man insisted and said, ""Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	60	" But Peter said, ""Man, I do not know what you are saying."" And immediately, while he was speaking, a rooster crowed.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	61	" Turning, the Lord  looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, when he said to him, ""Before a rooster crows today you will deny me three times.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	62	" Going outside, Peter wept bitterly.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	63	" Then the men guarding Jesus mocked and beat him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	64	" After blindfolding him, they asked him, saying, ""Prophesy! Who is the one who hit you?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	65	" They spoke many other things against Jesus, blaspheming him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	66	" As soon as it was day, the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes. They led him into the Council,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	67	" saying, ""If you are the Christ, tell us."" But he said to them, ""If I tell you, you will not believe,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	68	" and if I ask you, you will not answer.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	69	" But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	70	" They all said, ""Then you are the Son of God?"" And Jesus said to them, ""You say that I am.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	71	" They said, ""Why do we still need a witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	1 	"The whole company of them rose up, and brought Jesus before Pilate.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	2 	"They began to accuse him, saying, ""We found this man perverting our nation, forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	3 	"Pilate asked him, saying, ""Are you the King of the Jews?"" And Jesus answered him and said, ""You say so.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	4 	"Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, ""I find no fault in this man.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	5 	"But they were insisting, saying, ""He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	6 	"So when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	7 	"When he discovered that he was under Herod’s authority, he sent Jesus to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in those days.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	8 	"When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, because he had wanted to see him for a long time. He had heard about him and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	9 	"Herod questioned Jesus in many words, but Jesus answered him nothing.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	10	" The chief priests and the scribes stood, violently accusing him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	11	" Herod with his soldiers insulted him, and mocked him, and clothed him in beautiful clothing, then sent Jesus back to Pilate.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	12	" Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day (before they had been enemies).
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	13	" Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the crowd of people,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	14	" and said to them, ""You brought to me this man like a man who is leading the people to act badly, and see, I, having questioned him before you, find no fault in this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	15	" No, nor does Herod, for he sent him back to us, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	16	" I will therefore punish him, and release him.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	17	" Now Pilate was obligated to release to the Jews one prisoner at the feast.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	18	" But they cried out all together, saying, ""Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas!""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	19	" Barrabas was a man who had been put into prison for a certain rebellion in the city and for murder.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	20	" Pilate addressed them again, desiring to release Jesus.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	21	" But they shouted, saying, ""Crucify him, crucify him.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	22	" He said to them a third time, ""Why, what evil has this man done? I have found nothing deserving the death penalty in him. Therefore after punishing him, I will release him.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	23	" But they were insistent with loud voices, demanding for him to be crucified. And their voices convinced Pilate.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	24	" So Pilate decided to grant their demand.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	25	" He released the one they asked for who had been put in prison for rioting and murder. But he delivered up Jesus to their will.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	26	" As they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and they laid the cross on him to carry, following Jesus.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	27	" A great crowd of the people, and of women who grieved and mourned for him, were following him.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	28	" But turning to them, Jesus said, ""Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	29	" For see, the days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that did not bear, and the breasts that did not nurse.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	30	" Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.'
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	31	" For if they do these things while the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	32	" Other men, two criminals, were led away with him to be put to death.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	33	" When they came to the place which is called The Skull, there they crucified him and the criminals, one on the right of him and the other on the left.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	34	" Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."" And they cast lots, dividing up his garments.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	35	" The people stood watching while the rulers also were mocking him, saying, ""He saved others. Let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, the chosen one.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	36	" The soldiers also ridiculed him, approaching him, offering him vinegar,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	37	" and saying, ""If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	38	" There was also a sign over him, ""THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	39	" One of the criminals who was crucified, insulted him, saying, ""Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	40	" But the other answered, rebuking him said, ""Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	41	" We indeed are here justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds. But this man did nothing wrong.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	42	" And he added, ""Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	43	" Jesus said to him, ""Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	44	" It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	45	" as the sun's light failed. Then the curtain of the temple was split down the middle.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	46	" Crying with a loud voice, Jesus said, ""Father, into your hands I commit my spirit."" Having said this, he died.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	47	" When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, ""Surely this was a righteous man.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	48	" When all the multitudes who came together to witness this sight saw the things that were done, they returned beating their breasts.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	49	" But all of his acquaintances, and the women who followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	50	" Behold, there was a man named Joseph, belonging to the Council, a good and righteous man
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	51	" (he had not agreed with the decision and their action), from Arimathea, a Jewish city, who was waiting for the kingdom of God.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	52	" This man, approaching Pilate, asked for the body of Jesus.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	53	" He took it down, and wrapped it in fine linen, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	54	" It was the Day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was dawning.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	55	" The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb and how his body was laid.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	56	" They returned, and prepared spices and ointments.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	1 	"Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	2 	"They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	3 	"They entered in, but did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	4 	"It happened that, while they were confused about this, suddenly, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	5 	"As the women were filled with fear and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said to the women, ""Why do you seek the living among the dead?
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	6 	"He is not here, but is risen! Remember how he spoke to you when he was still in Galilee,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	7 	"saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and on the third day, rise again.""
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	8 	"The women remembered his words,
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	9 	"and returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and all the rest.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	10	" Now Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them reported these things to the apostles.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	11	" But this message seemed like idle talk to the apostles, and they did not believe the women.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	12	" Yet Peter rose up, and ran to the tomb, and stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves.  Peter then departed to his home, wondering what had happened.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	13	" Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	14	" They discussed with each other about all the things which had happened.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	15	" It happened that, while they discussed and questioned together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them.
"
LUK Unlocked Literal Bible	2	16	" But their eyes were prevented from recognizing him.
"
