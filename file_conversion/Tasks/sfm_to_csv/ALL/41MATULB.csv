MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	48	" But Jesus answered and said to him who told him, ""Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	49	" Then he stretched out his hand towards his disciples and said, ""See, here are my mother and my brothers!
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	50	" For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, that person is my brother, and sister, and  mother.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	1 	"On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	2 	"A very large crowd gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat in it; all the crowd stood on the beach.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	3 	"Then Jesus said many things to them in parables. He said, ""Behold, a sower went out to sow.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	4 	"As he sowed, some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and devoured them.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	5 	"Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil. Immediately they sprang up, because the soil had no depth.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	6 	"But when the sun had risen, they were scorched because they had no root, and they withered away.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	7 	"Other seeds fell among the thorn plants. The thorn plants grew up and choked them.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	8 	"Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	9 	"He who has ears, let him listen.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	10	" The disciples came and said to Jesus, ""Why do you talk to the crowd in parables?""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	11	" Jesus answered and said to them, ""You have been given the privilege of understanding mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	12	" Because whoever has, to him will be given more, and he will have a great deal. But whoever has not, from him will be taken away even what he has.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	13	" So I talk to them in parables, because although they see, they do not really see, and although they hear, they do not really hear, neither do they understand.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	14	To them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, that which says, 'While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand; While seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive.
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	15	For this people’s heart has become dull, And their ears are heavy of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest they should perhaps perceive with their eyes, Hear with their ears, Understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.'
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	16	" But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	17	" Truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things that you see, and did not see them, and to hear the things that you hear, and did not hear them.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	18	" Listen then to the parable of the sower.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	19	" When anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not understand it, then the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is he who was sown on the wayside.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	20	" He who was sown on the rocky ground is he who hears the word and receives it with joy immediately;
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	21	" yet he has no root in himself but endures for only a little while. When tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, he stumbles immediately.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	22	" He who was sown among the thorn plants, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	23	" He who was sown on the good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it; this is he who truly produces fruit and cultivates it ; some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	24	" Jesus presented another parable to them; he said, ""The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	25	" But while people slept, his enemy came and also sowed weeds among the wheat, and then went away.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	26	" When the blades sprouted and then produced their crop, then the weeds appeared also.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	27	" The servants of the landowner came and said to him, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How does it now have weeds?'
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	28	" He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' The servants said to him, 'So do you want us to go and pull them out?'
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	29	" The landowner said, 'No, or when you pull out the weeds, you might uproot the wheat with them.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	30	" Let both grow together until the harvest. At the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, ""First pull out the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.""'""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	31	" Then Jesus presented another parable to them. He said, ""The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	32	" This seed is indeed the smallest of all other seeds. But when it has grown, it is greater than the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	33	" Jesus then told them another parable. ""The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until it rose.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	34	" All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; and without parables he said nothing to them.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	35	"This was in order that what had been said through the prophet might come true, when he said, ""I will open my mouth in parables; I will say things that were hidden from the foundation of the world."""
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	36	" Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, ""Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	37	" Jesus answered and said, ""He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	38	" The field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one;
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	39	" and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are angels.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	40	" Therefore, as the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the world.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	41	" The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all the things that cause sin, and those who commit iniquity,
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	42	" and they will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	43	" Then will the righteous people shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him listen.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	44	" The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field; a man found it and hid it. In his joy he goes, sells everything he possesses, and buys that field.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	45	" Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a merchant looking for valuable pearls.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	46	" When he found one pearl of very great value, he went and sold everything that he possessed and bought it.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	47	" Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and that gathered creatures of every kind.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	48	" When it was filled, the fishermen drew it up on the beach. Then they sat down and gathered the good things into containers, but the worthless things they threw away.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	49	" It will be this way at the end of the world; the angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous,
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	50	" and they will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	51	" Have you understood all these things?"" The disciples said to him, ""Yes.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	52	" Then Jesus said to them, ""Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is the owner of a house, who withdraws old and new things from his treasure.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	53	" Then it came about that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from that place.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	54	" Then Jesus entered his own region and taught the people in their synagogue, with the result that they were astonished and said, ""Where does this man get his wisdom and these miracles from?
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	55	" Is not this man the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother Mary? And his brothers, are they not James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	56	" And his sisters, are they not all among us? So where does this man get all these things from?""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	57	" They were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, ""A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own family.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	58	" And he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	1 	"About that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus.

MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	2 	"He said to his servants, ""This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead. Therefore these powers are at work in

MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	3 	"For Herod had laid hold upon John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.

MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	4 	"For John had said to him, ""It is not lawful for you to have her as your wife.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	5 	"Herod would have put him to death, but he feared the people, because they regarded him as a prophet.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	6 	"But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst and pleased Herod.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	7 	"In response, he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	8 	"After being instructed by her mother, she said, ""Give me here, on a platter, the head of John the Baptist.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	9 	"The king was very upset by her request, but because of his oath, and because of all those at dinner with him, he ordered that it should be done. 
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	10	" He sent and beheaded John in the prison.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	11	" Then his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl and she took it to her mother.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	12	" Then his disciples came, took up the corpse, and buried it. After this, they went and told Jesus.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	13	" Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to an isolated place. When the crowds heard of it, they followed him on foot from the cities.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	14	" Then Jesus came before them and saw the large crowd. He had compassion on them and healed their sick.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	15	" When the evening had come, the disciples came to him and said, ""This is a deserted place, and day is already over. Dismiss the crowds, that they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	16	" But Jesus said to them, ""They have no need to go away; you give them something to eat.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	17	" They said to him, ""We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	18	" Jesus said, ""Bring them to me.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	19	" Then Jesus ordered the crowd to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up 
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	20	" They all ate and were filled. Then they took up what remained of the broken pieces of food—twelve baskets full.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	21	" Those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	22	" Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he himself would send the crowd away.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	23	" After he had sent the crowd away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had fully come, he was there alone.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	24	" But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, almost uncontrollable because of the waves, for the wind was contrary.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	25	" In the fourth watch of the night Jesus approached them; he was walking on the sea.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	26	" When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified and said, ""It is a ghost,"" and they cried out in

MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	27	" But Jesus spoke to them right away and said, ""Be brave! It is I! Be not afraid.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	28	" Peter answered him and said, ""Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	29	" Jesus said, ""Come."" So Peter got out from the boat and walked on the waters to go to Jesus.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	30	" But when Peter saw the wind, he became afraid; as he began to sink, he cried out and said, ""Lord, save me.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	31	" Jesus immediately stretched out his hand, took hold of Peter, and said to him, ""You of little faith,

MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	32	" Then when Jesus and Peter went into the boat, the wind ceased  blowing. 
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	33	" Then the disciples in the boat worshiped Jesus and said, ""Truly you are the Son of God.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	34	" When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	35	" When the men in that place recognized Jesus, they sent messages everywhere into the surrounding area, and they brought to him everyone who was sick. 
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	36	" They begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment, and as many as touched it were healed. 
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	1 	"Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem; they said,

MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	2 	"""Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	3 	"Jesus answered and said to them, ""And you—why do you violate the commandment of God for the sake of your traditions?

MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	4 	"For God said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'He who speaks evil of his father or mother, will surely die.'

MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	1	18	" But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. They are the things that defile a person.

MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	66	" What do you think?"" They answered and said, ""He is worthy of death.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	67	" Then they spat in his face and beat him, and struck him with the palms of their hands,
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	68	" and said, ""Prophesy to us, you Christ. Who is it that struck you?""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	69	" Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, ""You were also with Jesus of Galilee.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	70	" But he denied it in front of them all, saying, ""I do not know what you are talking about.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	71	" When he went out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to those there, ""This man
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	72	" And he denied again with an oath, ""I do not know the man.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	73	" After a little while those who were standing by  came and said to Peter, ""Surely you are also one of them, for your accent gives you away.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	74	" Then he began to curse and swear, ""I do not know the man,"" and immediately a rooster crowed.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	75	" Peter remembered the words that Jesus had said, ""Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times."" Then he went outside and wept bitterly.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	1 	"Now when morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people plotted against Jesus to put him to
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	2 	"They bound him, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate the governor.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	3 	"Then when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been condemned, he repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	4 	"and said, ""I have sinned by betraying innocent blood."" But they said, ""What is that to us? See to that yourself.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	5 	"Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went out and hanged himself.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	6 	"The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, ""It is not lawful to put this into the treasury, because it is the
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	7 	"They discussed the matter together and with the money bought the Potter’s Field to bury strangers in.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	8 	"For this reason that field has been called, ""The field of blood"" to this day.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	9 	"Then that which had been spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, ""They took the thirty pieces of silver,
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	10	" and they gave it for the potter’s field, as the Lord had directed me.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	11	" Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, ""Are you the King of the Jews?"" Jesus answered him, ""You say so.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	12	" But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	13	" Then Pilate said to him, ""Do you not hear all the charges against you?""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	14	" But he did not answer even one word, so that the governor was greatly amazed.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	15	" Now at the feast it was the custom of the governor to release one prisoner chosen by the crowd.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	16	" At that time they had a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	17	" So when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, ""Who do  you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	18	" Because he knew that they had handed him over because of envy.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	19	" While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him and said, ""Have nothing to do with that
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	20	" Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas, and have Jesus killed.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	21	" The governor asked them, ""Which of the two do you want  me to release to you?"" They said, ""Barabbas.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	22	" Pilate said to them, ""What should I do with Jesus who is called Christ?"" They all answered, ""Crucify him.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	23	" And he said, ""Why, what crime has he done?"" But they cried out even louder, ""Crucify him.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	24	" So when Pilate saw that he could not do anything, but instead a riot was starting, he took water, washed his hands in front of the crowd, and said, ""I am innocent of the blood of this innocent man; see to it yourselves.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	25	" All the people said, ""May his blood be on us and our children.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	26	" Then he released Barabbas to them, but he scourged Jesus and handed him over to be crucified.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	27	" Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	28	" They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	29	" Then they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and placed a staff in his right hand, and they knelt down before
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	30	" And they spat on him, and they took the staff and struck him on the head.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	31	" When they had mocked him, they took the robe off him and put his own garments on him, and led him away to crucify him.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	32	" As they came out, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they forced to go with them so that he might carry his cross.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	33	" They came to a place called Golgotha, which means, ""The Place of a Skull.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	34	" They gave him wine to drink mixed with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	35	" When they had crucified him, they divided up his garments by casting lots;
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	36	" and they sat and watched him.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	37	" Above his head they put the charge against him which read, ""THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	38	" Two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right of him and one on the left.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	39	" Those who passed by insulted him, shaking their heads
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	40	" and saying, ""You who were going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of God, 
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	41	" In the same way the chief priests were mocking him, along with the scribes and elders, and said,
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	42	" ""He saved others, but he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down off the cross, and then we will 
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	43	" He trusts in God; let God rescue him now if he wants to, because he said, 'I am the Son of God.'""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	44	" And the robbers who were crucified with him also spoke the same insults to him.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	45	" Now from the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	46	" About the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice and said, ""Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?"" which means, ""My God, my God, why 
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	47	" When some of those who were standing there heard it, they said, ""He is calling for Elijah.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	48	" Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed staff, and gave it to him to drink.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	49	" The rest of them said, ""Leave him alone; let us see whether Elijah comes to save him.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	50	" Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	51	" Behold, the curtain of the temple was split in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks 
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	52	" The tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	53	" They came out of the tombs after his resurrection, entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	54	" Now when the centurion and those that were watching Jesus saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they became very afraid and said, ""Truly this was the Son of God.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	55	" Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for him were there looking on from a distance.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	56	" Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	57	" When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	58	" He approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	59	" Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	60	" and laid it in his own new tomb that he had cut into the rock. Then he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb and went away.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	61	" Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	62	" The next day, which was the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	63	" They said, ""Sir, we remember that when that deceiver was alive, he said, 'After three days will I rise again.'
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	64	" Therefore command that the tomb be made secure until the third day; otherwise his disciples may come and steal him
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	65	" Pilate said to them, ""Take a guard; go and make it as secure as you can.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	66	" So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and placing the guard.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	1 	"Now late on the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	2 	"Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, came and rolled away the
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	3 	"His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	4 	"The guards shook with fear and became like dead men.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	5 	"The angel addressed the women and said to them, ""Do not be in terror, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	6 	"He is not here, but is risen, just as he said. Come see the place where the Lord lay.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	7 	"Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead; and see, he is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' See, I have told you.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	8 	"The women quickly left the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	9 	"Behold, Jesus met them and said, ""All hail."" The women came, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	10	" Then Jesus said to them, ""Do not be afraid. Go tell my brothers to leave for Galilee; there they will see me. ""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	11	" Now while the women were going, behold, some of the guards went into the city and told to the chief priests all the things that had happened.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	12	" When the priests had met with the elders and discussed the matter with them, they gave a large amount of money to the soldiers
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	13	" and told them, ""Say to others, 'Jesus' disciples came by night and stole his body while we were sleeping.'
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	14	" If this report reaches the governor, we will persuade him and take any worries away from you.""
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	15	" So the soldiers took the money and did as they had been instructed. This report spread widely among the Jews and continues even today. 
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	16	" But the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	17	" When they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	18	" Jesus came to them and spoke to them and said, ""All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
"
MAT Unlocked Literal Bible	2	19	" Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations. Baptize them into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of
