"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	18	" The birth of Jesus Christ happened in the following way. His mother Mary was engaged to marry Joseph, but before they came

"	1	19	" Her husband Joseph was a righteous man, but he did not want to disgrace her publicly. So he decided to secretly end his engagement with her.

"	2	4 	"Herod brought together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, and he asked them, ""Where is the Christ to be born?""

"	2	10	" When they saw the star, they rejoiced with very great joy.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	11	" They went into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother; they bowed down and worshiped him. They opened their treasures and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	12	" God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they departed to their own country by another way.

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	13	" After they had departed, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, ""Get up, take the young child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Remain there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.""

"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	3	2 	"""Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.""

"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	3	13	" Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	3	14	" But John would have stopped him, saying, ""I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	3	15	" Jesus responded and said to him, ""Permit it now, for it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness."" Then John permitted him.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	3	16	" After he was baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and appearing on him.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	3	17	" Behold, a voice came out of the heavens saying, ""This is my beloved Son. I am very pleased with him.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	4	1 	"Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	4	2 	"When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	4	3 	"The tempter came and said to him, ""If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	4	4 	"But Jesus answered and said to him, ""It is written, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God.'""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	4	5 	"Then the devil took him into the Holy City and set him on the highest point of the temple building,

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	4	6 	"and said to him, ""If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written,'He will command his angels to take care of you,'and,'They will lift you up in their hands,so that you will not hit your foot against a stone.'""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	4	7 	"Jesus said to him, ""Again it is written, 'You must not test the Lord your God.'""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	4	8 	"Again, the devil took him up to a high place and showed him all the kingdoms of the world along with all their splendor.

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	4	9 	"He said to him, ""All these things I will give you, if you bow down and worship me.""

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible

"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	4	11	" Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	4	12	" Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	4	13	" He left Nazareth and went and lived in Capernaum, which is by the Sea of Galilee, in the territories of Zebulun and Naphtali.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	4	14	" This happened so that it might come true what had been spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	4	17	" From that time Jesus began to preach and say, ""Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has drawn near.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	4	18	" As he was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.

"	4	20	" Immediately they left the nets and followed him.

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	5	13	" You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again? It is never again good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under by people's feet.

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	5	17	" Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets; I have come not to destroy them, but to fulfill them.

"	5	44	" But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,

"	1	18	" Listen then to the parable of the sower.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	19	" When anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not understand it, then the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is he who was sown on the wayside.

"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	31	" Then Jesus presented another parable to them. He said, ""The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	32	" This seed is indeed the smallest of all other seeds. But when it has grown, it is greater than the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	33	" Jesus then told them another parable. ""The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until it rose.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	34	" All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; and without parables he said nothing to them.

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	35	" This was in order that what had been said through the prophet might come true, when he said,""I will open my mouth in parables;I will say things that were hidden from the foundation of the world.""

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	36	" Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, ""Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	37	" Jesus answered and said, ""He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	38	" The field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one;

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	39	" and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are angels.

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	40	" Therefore, as the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of the world.

"	1	43	" Then will the righteous people shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him listen.

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	44	" The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field; a man found it and hid it. In his joy he goes, sells everything he possesses, and buys that field.

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	45	" Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a merchant looking for valuable pearls.

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	46	" When he found one pearl of very great value, he went and sold everything that he possessed and bought it.

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	47	" Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and that gathered creatures of every kind.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	48	" When it was filled, the fishermen drew it up on the beach. Then they sat down and gathered the good things into containers, but the worthless things they threw away.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	49	" It will be this way at the end of the world; the angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous,

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	50	" and they will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	51	" Have you understood all these things?"" The disciples said to him, ""Yes.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	52	" Then Jesus said to them, ""Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is the owner of a house, who withdraws old and new things from his treasure.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	53	" Then it came about that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from that place.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	54	" Then Jesus entered his own region and taught the people in their synagogue, with the result that they were astonished and said, ""Where does this man get his wisdom and these miracles from?

"	1	56	" And his sisters, are they not all among us? So where does this man get all these things from?""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	57	" They were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, ""A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own family.""

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	14	" Then Jesus came before them and saw the large crowd. He had compassion on them and healed their sick.

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	15	" When the evening had come, the disciples came to him and said, ""This is a deserted place, and day is already over. Dismiss the crowds, that they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves.""

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	17	" They said to him, ""We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	22	" Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he himself would send the crowd away.

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	1	24	" But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, almost uncontrollable because of the waves, for the wind was contrary.

"	2	16	" Then they sent to him their disciples, together with the Herodians. They said to Jesus, ""Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and that you teach God's way in truth, and that you care for no one's opinion, and you do not show partiality between people.

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	23	" On that day some Sadducees came to him, those who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him,

"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	35	" One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing himâ€”
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible

"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	37	" Jesus said to him, ""'You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	38	" This is the great and first commandment.

"	2	39	" And a second commandment is like itâ€”'You must love your neighbor as yourself.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	40	" On these two commandments depend the whole law and the prophets.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	41	" Now while the Pharisees were still gathered together, Jesus asked them a question.

"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	42	" He said, ""What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?"" They said to him,

"	2	6 	"But at midnight there was a cry, 'Look, the bridegroom! Go out and meet him.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	7 	"Then all those virgins rose up and trimmed their lamps.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	8 	"The foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil because our lamps are going out.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	9 	"But the wise answered and said, 'Since there will not be enough for us and you, go instead  to those who sell and
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	10	" While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	11	" Afterward the other virgins also came and said, 'Master, master, open for us.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	12	" But he answered and said, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	13	" Watch therefore, for you do not know the day or the hour.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	14	" For it is like when a man was about to go into another country; he called his own servants and gave over to them his wealth.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	15	" To one of them he gave five talents, to another he gave two, and to yet another he gave one talentâ€”each according to his own ability, and he went
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	16	" Immediately the one who received the five talents went, traded with them, and made another five talents.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	17	" Likewise the one who had received two talents made another two.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	18	" But the servant who had received one talent went away, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	19	" Now after a long time the master of those servants came back and settled accounts with them.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	20	" The servant who had received five talents came and brought another five talents as well; he said, 'Master, you gave me five talents. See, I have made five more talents.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	21	" His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things; I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	22	" The servant who had received two talents came and said, 'Master, you gave me two talents. See, I have made two more talents.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	23	" His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things; I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	24	" Then the servant who had received one talent came and said, 'Master, I know that you are a strict man; you reap where you did not sow, and you harvest where you did not scatter.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	25	" I was afraid, so I went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have here what belongs to you.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	26	" But his master answered and said him, 'You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sowed and harvest where I have not  scattered.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	27	" Therefore you should have given my money to the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	28	" Therefore take away the talent from him and give it to the servant who has ten talents.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	29	" For to everyone who possesses, more will be givenâ€”even more abundantly. But from anyone who does not possess anything, even what he does have will be taken away.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	30	" Throw the worthless servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	31	" When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious  throne.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	32	" Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate the people one from another, as a shepherd separates
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	33	" He will place the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	34	" Then the King will say to those on his right hand, 'Come, you who have been blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	35	" For I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me a drink; I was a stranger and you took me in;
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	36	" I was naked, and you clothed me; I was sick and you cared for me; I was in prison and you came to me.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	37	" Then the righteous will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you? Or thirsty and give you a 
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	38	" And when did we see you a stranger, and take you in? Or naked and clothe you?
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	39	" And when did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	40	" And the King will answer and say to them, 'Truly I say to you, what you did for one of the least of my brothers here, you did it for me.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	41	" Then he will say to those on his left hand, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	42	" because I was hungry but you did not give me food; I was thirsty but you did not give me a  drink;
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	43	" I was a stranger but you did not take me in; naked but you did not clothe me; sick and in prison, but you did not care for me.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	44	" Then they will also answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	45	" Then he will answer them and say, 'Truly I say to you, what you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	46	" These will go away into eternal punishment but the righteous into eternal life.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	1 	"It came about that when Jesus had finished all these words, he said to his disciples,
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	2 	"""You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	3 	"Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the palace of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas;
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	4 	"They plotted together to arrest Jesus stealthily and kill him.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	5 	"For they were saying, ""Not during the feast, so that a riot does not arise among the people.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	6 	"Now while Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	7 	"as he was reclining at table, a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it upon his head.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	8 	"But when his disciples saw it, they became angry and said, ""What is the reason for this waste?
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	9 	"This could have been sold for a large amount and given to the poor.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	10	" But Jesus, knowing this, said to them, ""Why are you troubling this woman? For she has done a beautiful thing for me.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	11	" You always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	12	" For when she poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	13	" Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of in memory of her.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	14	" Then one of the twelve, who was named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	15	" and said, ""What are you willing to give me to deliver him to you?"" They weighed out thirty pieces of silver for him.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	16	" From that moment he sought an opportunity to deliver him to them.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	17	" Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus and said, ""Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	18	" He said, ""Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, 'The Teacher says, ""My time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.""'""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	19	" The disciples did as Jesus directed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	20	" When evening came, he sat down to eat with the twelve disciples.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	21	" As they were eating, he said, ""Truly I say to you that one of you will betray me.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	22	" They were very sorrowful, and each one began to ask him, ""Surely not I, Lord?""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	23	" He answered, ""The one who dips his hand with me in the dish is the one who will betray me.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	24	" The Son of Man will go, just as it is written about him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	25	" Judas, who would betray him said, ""Is it I, Rabbi?"" He said to him, ""You have said it yourself.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	26	" As they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed it, and broke it. He gave it to the disciples and said, ""Take, eat. This is my body.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	27	" He took a cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them and said, ""Drink it, all of you;
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	28	" for this is my blood of the covenant that is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	29	" But I say to you, I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	30	" When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	31	" Then Jesus said to them, ""All of you will fall away tonight because of me, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	32	" But after I am raised up, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	33	" But Peter said to him, ""Even if all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	34	" Jesus said to him, ""Truly I say to you, this very night before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	35	" Peter said to him, ""Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you."" And all the other disciples said the same thing.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	36	" Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane and said to his disciples, ""Sit here while I go over there and pray.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	37	" He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him and began to become sorrowful and troubled.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	38	" Then he said to them, ""My soul is deeply sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch with me.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	39	" He went a little further, fell on his face, and prayed; he said, ""My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	40	" He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, ""What, could you not watch with me for one hour?
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	41	" Watch and pray that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	42	" He went away a second time and prayed; he said, ""My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, your will be done.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	43	" He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	44	" Then he left them again and went away; he prayed a third time and said the same words.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	45	" Then Jesus came to the disciples and said to them, ""Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Look, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	46	" Arise, let us go. Look, the one who is betraying me is near.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	47	" While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came. A large crowd came with him from 
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	48	" Now the man who was going to betray Jesus had given them a signal, saying, ""Whomever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	49	" Immediately he came up to Jesus and said, ""Greetings, Rabbi!"" And he kissed him.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	50	" Jesus said to him, ""Friend, do what you have come to do."" Then they came, laid hands on Jesus, and seized him.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	51	" Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the servant of the 
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	52	" Then Jesus said to him, ""Put your sword back in its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	53	" Do you think that I could not call upon my Father, and he would send me more than twelve legions of angels?
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	54	" But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled, that this must happen?""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	55	" At that time Jesus said to the crowd, ""Have you come out with swords and clubs to seize me like a robber? I sat 
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	56	" But all this has happened so that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled."" Then all the disciples left him and fled.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	57	" Those who had seized Jesus led him away to 
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	58	" But Peter followed him from a distance to the courtyard of the high priest; he went inside and sat down with the guards to see the 
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	59	" Now the chief priests and the whole Council were looking for false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put him to death.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	60	" They did not find any, even though many false witnesses came forward. But later two came forward
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	61	" and said, ""This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	62	" The high priest stood up and said to him, ""Do you have no answer? What is it that they are testifying against you?""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	63	" But Jesus was silent. The high priest said to him, ""I command you by the living God, tell us whether
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	64	" Jesus replied to him, ""You have said it yourself; but I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	65	" Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, ""He has spoken blasphemy. Why do we still need witnesses? Look,
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	66	" What do you think?"" They answered and said, ""He is worthy of death.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	67	" Then they spat in his face and beat him, and struck him with the palms of their hands,
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	68	" and said, ""Prophesy to us, you Christ. Who is it that struck you?""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	69	" Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, ""You were also with Jesus of Galilee.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	70	" But he denied it in front of them all, saying, ""I do not know what you are talking about.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	71	" When he went out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to those there, ""This man
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	72	" And he denied again with an oath, ""I do not know the man.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	73	" After a little while those who were standing by  came and said to Peter, ""Surely you are also one of them, for your accent gives you away.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	74	" Then he began to curse and swear, ""I do not know the man,"" and immediately a rooster crowed.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	75	" Peter remembered the words that Jesus had said, ""Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times."" Then he went outside and wept bitterly.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	1 	"Now when morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people plotted against Jesus to put him to
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	2 	"They bound him, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate the governor.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	3 	"Then when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been condemned, he repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	4 	"and said, ""I have sinned by betraying innocent blood."" But they said, ""What is that to us? See to that yourself.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	5 	"Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went out and hanged himself.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	6 	"The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, ""It is not lawful to put this into the treasury, because it is the
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	7 	"They discussed the matter together and with the money bought the Potterâ€™s Field to bury strangers in.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	8 	"For this reason that field has been called, ""The field of blood"" to this day.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	9 	"Then that which had been spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, ""They took the thirty pieces of silver,
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	10	" and they gave it for the potterâ€™s field, as the Lord had directed me.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	11	" Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, ""Are you the King of the Jews?"" Jesus answered him, ""You say so.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	12	" But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	13	" Then Pilate said to him, ""Do you not hear all the charges against you?""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	14	" But he did not answer even one word, so that the governor was greatly amazed.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	15	" Now at the feast it was the custom of the governor to release one prisoner chosen by the crowd.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	16	" At that time they had a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	17	" So when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, ""Who do  you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	18	" Because he knew that they had handed him over because of envy.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	19	" While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him and said, ""Have nothing to do with that
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	20	" Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas, and have Jesus killed.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	21	" The governor asked them, ""Which of the two do you want  me to release to you?"" They said, ""Barabbas.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	22	" Pilate said to them, ""What should I do with Jesus who is called Christ?"" They all answered, ""Crucify him.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	23	" And he said, ""Why, what crime has he done?"" But they cried out even louder, ""Crucify him.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	24	" So when Pilate saw that he could not do anything, but instead a riot was starting, he took water, washed his hands in front of the crowd, and said, ""I am innocent of the blood of this innocent man; see to it yourselves.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	25	" All the people said, ""May his blood be on us and our children.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	26	" Then he released Barabbas to them, but he scourged Jesus and handed him over to be crucified.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	27	" Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	28	" They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	29	" Then they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and placed a staff in his right hand, and they knelt down before
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	30	" And they spat on him, and they took the staff and struck him on the head.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	31	" When they had mocked him, they took the robe off him and put his own garments on him, and led him away to crucify him.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	32	" As they came out, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they forced to go with them so that he might carry his cross.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	33	" They came to a place called Golgotha, which means, ""The Place of a Skull.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	34	" They gave him wine to drink mixed with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	35	" When they had crucified him, they divided up his garments by casting lots;
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	36	" and they sat and watched him.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	37	" Above his head they put the charge against him which read, ""THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	38	" Two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right of him and one on the left.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	39	" Those who passed by insulted him, shaking their heads
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	40	" and saying, ""You who were going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of God, 
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	41	" In the same way the chief priests were mocking him, along with the scribes and elders, and said,
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	42	" ""He saved others, but he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down off the cross, and then we will 
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	43	" He trusts in God; let God rescue him now if he wants to, because he said, 'I am the Son of God.'""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	44	" And the robbers who were crucified with him also spoke the same insults to him.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	45	" Now from the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	46	" About the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice and said, ""Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?"" which means, ""My God, my God, why 
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	47	" When some of those who were standing there heard it, they said, ""He is calling for Elijah.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	48	" Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed staff, and gave it to him to drink.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	49	" The rest of them said, ""Leave him alone; let us see whether Elijah comes to save him.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	50	" Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	51	" Behold, the curtain of the temple was split in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks 
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	52	" The tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	53	" They came out of the tombs after his resurrection, entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	54	" Now when the centurion and those that were watching Jesus saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they became very afraid and said, ""Truly this was the Son of God.""
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	55	" Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for him were there looking on from a distance.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	56	" Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	57	" When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	58	" He approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	59	" Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	60	" and laid it in his own new tomb that he had cut into the rock. Then he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb and went away.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	61	" Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.
"
"MAT Unlocked Literal Bible
"	2	62	" The next day, which was the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered
